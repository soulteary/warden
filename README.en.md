# Warden

> 🌐 **Language / 语言**: [English](README.en.md) | [中文](README.md)

A high-performance AllowList user data service that supports data synchronization and merging from local and remote configuration sources.

> **Warden** (The Gatekeeper) — The guardian of the Stargate who decides who may pass and who will be denied. Just as the Warden of Stargate guards the Stargate, Warden guards your allowlist, ensuring only authorized users can pass through.

## 📋 Project Overview

Warden is a lightweight HTTP API service developed in Go, primarily used for providing and managing allowlist user data (phone numbers and email addresses). The service supports fetching data from local configuration files and remote APIs, and provides multiple data merging strategies to ensure data real-time performance and reliability.

## ✨ Core Features

- 🚀 **High Performance**: Supports 5000+ requests per second with an average latency of 21ms
- 🔄 **Multiple Data Sources**: Supports both local configuration files and remote APIs
- 🎯 **Flexible Strategies**: Provides 6 data merging modes (remote-first, local-first, remote-only, local-only, etc.)
- ⏰ **Scheduled Updates**: Scheduled tasks based on Redis distributed locks for automatic data synchronization
- 📦 **Containerized Deployment**: Complete Docker support, ready to use out of the box
- 📊 **Structured Logging**: Uses zerolog to provide detailed access logs and error logs
- 🔒 **Distributed Locks**: Uses Redis to ensure scheduled tasks don't execute repeatedly in distributed environments

## 🏗️ Architecture Design

Warden uses a layered architecture design, including HTTP layer, business layer, and infrastructure layer. The system supports multiple data sources, multi-level caching, and distributed locking mechanisms.

## 📦 Installation and Running

> 💡 **Quick Start**: Want to quickly experience Warden? Check out our [Quick Start Examples](example/README.en.md) / [快速开始示例](example/README.md):
> - [Simple Example](example/basic/README.en.md) / [简单示例](example/basic/README.md) - Basic usage, local data file only
> - [Advanced Example](example/advanced/README.en.md) / [复杂示例](example/advanced/README.md) - Full features, including remote API and Mock service

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25+ (refer to [go.mod](go.mod))
- Redis (for distributed locks and caching)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the project**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd warden
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
go mod download
```

3. **Configure local data file**
Create a `data.json` file (refer to `data.example.json`):
```json
[
    {
        "phone": "13800138000",
        "mail": "admin@example.com"
    }
]
```

4. **Run the service**
```bash
go run main.go
```
